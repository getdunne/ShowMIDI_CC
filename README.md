# ShowMIDI
![](showmidicc.png)

This is a very simple MIDI effect (can be inserted in the MIDI effects slot of Apple Logic Pro X) to visualize MIDI input activity on any number of MIDI CC (continuous controller) dials.

This is intended as a companion to my [ShowMIDI](https://github.com/getdunne/ShowMIDI) plug-in, which visualizes MIDI keyboard, pitch-bend, and mod-wheel activity.

Requires [JUCE 5.x](https://shop.juce.com/get-juce), hence subject to the GNU GPL v3 license. Use the *Projucer* to generate the necessary projects, e.g. VST2 for Windows, Audio Unit for Mac.

If you can't or don't want to build these plug-ins from source, pre-built executables are available in the [Prebuilt folder](Prebuilt).
